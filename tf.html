<h1>Tankfest Northwest: Historical Hardware Puts on a Display for Memorial Day</h1>

<p>In a pair of hangars at the south end of Paine Field, the <a href="http://www.flyingheritage.com/">Flying Hertitage Collection</a> maintains a collection of artifacts from military and aviation history. Many of the vehicles housed there are, in fact, still maintained in an operable state. At various dates during the year, you can see World War II aircraft take flight. Meanwhile, every Memorial Day, the museum rolls out its land-bound vehicles for Tankfest Northwest.</p>

<p><img src="stuart.jpg" title="M3 Stuart"><br/><br/> The displays opened with a literal bang as a cannon (specifically, an infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.8_cm_Flak_18/36/37/41">German 88</a>) fired off a few volleys (using blanks, naturally!). Following that, we were able to watch reenactors perform manuvers alongside some authentic vehicles, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3_Stuart">M3 Stuart</a> and the iconic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_Sherman">M4 Sherman</a>. Besides the active ground vehicles, the price of admission for the day included access to the aircraft collection.</p>
