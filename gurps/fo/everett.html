		<strong>Boeing Everett Factory</strong> (47.925718, -122.271845) is the city's primary employer, and the largest building in the world! From these assembly lines roll out some of the most iconic American aircraft, both for civilian and defense.

		<strong>Paine AFB</strong> (47.906111, -122.281111), home to the 57th Fighter Group, helping protect the skies above the Emerald City and vicinity.

The skies above Everett are thus abuzz with activity, from new 868s rolling out, to old 828s coming in for refurbishing, to Banshees going out on maneuvers.
