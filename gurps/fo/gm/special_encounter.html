<h2>Aliens! (bounty hunters)</h2>
<p>Pair of Alien Bounty Hunters armed with TL9 Plasma Blaster Carbines, will only blast small hairy things unless disturbed.</p>

<h2>USAF</h2>
<p>The party comes upon an underground chamber, with an
enormous, warm metal statue inside. Inscribed on the side of
the statue is the name of the deity - Usaf. The sheer might and
power of the statue is enough to make anyone in the party a
believer. The statue of Usaf is, of course, a missile with
"U.S.A.F." on the side.</p>

<h2>Aliens!</h2>
<p>Shot-down UFO with 'sectoid' aliens trying in vain to effect
repairs. Sectoids are armed with Plasma Rifles and have
telepathic powers.</p>
