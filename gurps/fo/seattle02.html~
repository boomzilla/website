	<h3>Interesting and Important Locales:</h3>

		<strong>University of Washington</strong> (47.655, -122.308), home to some of the brightest young minds in the United States. The "U Dub", as locals call it, is particularly renowned for its engineering school, including the Department of Electrical, Robotic, and Computer Engineering, located in the bold new Grates Hall (47.653283,-122.308037); and the Department of Nuclear Engineering, known for being one of the few engineering departments to allow undergraduates to perform experiments on a functional fusion reactor, at Teller Hall (47.652752,-122.304815).
