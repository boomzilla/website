	<p>Here are gear to buy at character creation.</p>
	<p>You will start with $1000 worth of gear to yourself. This can be lowered or raised by taking negative or positive Wealth. You will *also* recieve a modicum of supplies from the vault quartermaster (which aren't technically yours, and will be exptected to be returned if/when you reteurn home). Yes, $1000 means 1,000 bottlecaps, *but* I am *not* going to allow you to have any bottlecaps to begin with. It would just be too meta-game-y to have your vault dwellers know right off-hand that Nuka Cola bottle caps are currency. If you *do* want something currency-like to begin with (and, feel free to offer the suggestion that Vault 45 uses these as a improvised currency), some options include: cigarettes (which totally acted as currency in WWII POW camps), bullets, match sticks, etc.</p>
	<h1>Clothing and Armor</h1>
		<h2>misc clothing</h2>
			<h3>set of basic clothing</h3>

	<h1>Food and Misc</h1>
		<h2>Food</h2>
			<h3>Drinkable water, quart</h3>
				<p>
		<strong>Cost: $1</strong><br/>
		<strong>Weight: 2 lbs</strong><br/>
		This represents just the water: buy something like a canteen to hold it. Mechanically, at least two quarts of water are needed per day for a character to stave off dehydration.
	</p>
	<h3>Nuka Cola, bottle</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>Cost: $4</strong><br/>
		<strong>Weight: 1 lbs</strong><br/>
		Popular brand of pre-War soft drink. Comes in iconic 12 ounce bottle. (consider it to be 1/3 quart of water for fending of dehydration). Mechanically, at least two quarts of water are needed per day for a character to stave off dehydration.
	</p>
	<h3>Canned food</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>Cost: $2</strong><br/>
		<strong>Weight: 1 lbs</strong><br/>
		Can of canned food. Mechanically, satisfies one (of three) daily meals for a person to stay healthy.
	</p>
	<h3>MRE</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>Cost: $5</strong><br/>
		<strong>Weight: 0.5 lbs</strong><br/>
		Packaged of pre-War preserved food used by military and survivalists. Mechanically, satisfies one (of three) daily meals for a person to stay healthy.
	</p>
	<h3>Hardtack</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>Cost: $1</strong><br/>
		<strong>Weight: 1 lbs</strong><br/>
		Not particularly appetizing, but it's very cheap and keeps very well. Mechanically, satisfies one (of three) daily meals for a person to stay healthy.	
	</p>
	<h2>Recreational substances</h2>
	<h3>Alcohol: shot of moonshine</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>Cost: $0.25</strong><br/>
		<strong>Weight: neg.</strong><br/>
		Ethanol is one of the easiest drugs to make, an early TL1 tech! This represents high-ethanol content stuff that you'd drink if you're just an addict interested in getting drunk. Price also goes up for stuff like beer and wine. 
	</p>
	<h3>Tobacco: single cigarette</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>Cost: $1</strong><br/>
		<strong>Weight: neg.</strong><br/>
		A single tobacco cigarette: nicotine heads have a much more difficult time in the Wasteland where tobacco is hard to come by. Loose, unrolled tobacco can probably be had for slightly less, but I'm not going to worry about it unless a PC has an Addiction disadvantage (Tobacco addiction is worth -20 points since the product is so expensive)
	</p>
		<h2>misc</h3>
			<h3>set of basic toiletries</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>Cost: ??? (but assume you have a set for free to begin with)</strong><br/>
					<strong>Weight: 2 lbs</strong><br/>
					A set of basic personal care items. Don't feel like accounting for every single little thing if you don't want to, but assume that some of these items could be improvised for "adventuring" scenarios: dental floss for fishing line, tampons to stop bleeding, soap to prevent spread of deadly virus, etc.
