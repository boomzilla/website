		<p>Tariq's second-cousin. The closest member of his family to survive Fall. Like Tariq, she grew up on the rough side of Dhaka. After the Fall, her backup was recovered and put into indentured servitude, where testing showed she had an aptitude for law. She was put to use as a sort of infomorph "paralegal" for a half decade before finally buying her freedom, and egocasting herself to Extropia.</p>
		<p>Nur works as a legal expert, specializing in Sharia, but also being a competant lawyer for secular extropian contract law. Although she remains religious, she deviates from many of the stereotype of Abrahamic ideologies: for instance, she has a decidedly non-biochauvanist bent, seeing AGIs as possessing souls as much as humans (the Koran, after all, spoke of non-human beings such as Djinn). She herself does not even sleeve into a morph. Nevertheless, she is quite critical of the common secularism of the post-Fall world, which she sees as "spiritual death". She prefers that people hold any religion, not necessarily Islam.</p>
		<p>She and Tariq hold a tenuous bond. They are distant family members, but they had almost no other family members survive the Fall. Nevertheless, Nur prefers not to let Tariq get too close: Tariq still being involved in criminal stuff, and she working in law. In short, their career choices differentiate them more than their shared blood unites them.</p>
