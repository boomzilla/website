	<p><img src="The-Stanley-Cup.jpg" align="left">There are a variety of derivations on ice hockey possible in the post-Fall solar system. The <strong>Heritage Hockey League</strong>, however, inherets largely from the classic NHL (an organization that lasted until the Fall), playing in Titanian stadiums surfaced with old-fashioned dihydrogen oxide in solid form (as opposed to, say, some of the solid hydrocarbon rinks possible in the Titanian outside). HHL hockey remains largely recognizable to a viewer from the 21st Century, with limited morphs and augmentations allowed. The big difference is rink size, which is increased to allow for the decreased Titanian gravity. HHL even names many of its teams after classic NHL franchises; the season's winner is rewarded with a replica Stanley Cup (sadly, the original artifact was lost in the Fall). The rival "Lunar Hockey League" also lays claims to the NHL's iconic trophy, and has even taken the Titanian org to task with legal injuctions, charging violation of intellectual property. Many people, however--even many Lunarians--consider the HHL to be the "actual" descendant of the NHL, since most of the surviving NHL stars went on to Titan (as opposed to other polities).</p>

	<p>Following is a list of present teams (and their stadiums). After a 50-game regular season, the top four teams go onto the best-of-five playoffs. The Habitants Lavalle are this season's favorite, followed by the rival Trudeau-Macalester Maple Leafs.</p>
