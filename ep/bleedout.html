[22:37:14] Ian Ruotsala: Umm... I think I died, actually... the g-force damage plus damage from getting shot exceeded my Durability (tho not my Death Rating). But I would have started bleeding at that point (unless the GM decides to rule that the g-foces inflicted more crunchy damage (broken bones, etc) that squirty damage (severed artires etc).  Good news is that I have medichines, so according to core page 326, I can be revived :D. Even if I didn't bleed to death, according to core 308, medichines will put you into stasis if you take 6+ wounds in an hour (and I totally did).
[22:37:38] Ian Ruotsala: tl;dr, I am in statis, I am possibly dead, but I will be fine after a few days in healing vat. :)
[22:43:33] Ian Ruotsala: 6 days in a healing vat according to 327
[22:44:00] Ian Ruotsala: I can RP Huey's muse, I guess, while he is brought back from the dead :)
[22:59:21] Ian Ruotsala: Oh, wait, it just puts you into stasis if you suffer "more than 6 wounds" in an hour (not 6+). Hmm.
[23:00:44] Ian Ruotsala: Well, I'd still be in stasis from bleeding out, I guess. (Okay, sorry to keep spamming this thread, I'll STFU for awhile now).

[23:01:24] Philip Schurter: na, its fine
[23:01:33] Philip Schurter: you're basically not dead enough
[23:01:35] Philip Schurter: to actually be dead
[23:01:50] Philip Schurter: if it exceeds your DUR, you go unconscious
[23:02:03] Philip Schurter: but you have medicines to stabilize you
[23:02:17] Philip Schurter: so you won't bleed out
[23:02:38] Ian Ruotsala: Oh? I didn't see anything about medichines stopping you from bleeding out. Let me re-read.
[23:02:47] Philip Schurter: well, you're in stasis
[23:02:55] Philip Schurter: since you have what, six wounds?
[23:02:59] Ian Ruotsala: yeah
