    <h2>game summary for 2015, May 24</h2>

	<p>We began the campaign as indents, about to be freed, on our last mission for our owner, one Leon Krone. Aboard Krone's ship, the <em>Freeman</em>, we were briefed that we would dock with the <em>Futai Hira</em>, a station from cis-Lunar space that, around the time of the Fall, had boosted itself to the Asteroid Belt. A source of strong interference was eminating from within the <em>Futai</em>, preventing us from easily interfacing with its systems.</p>
	<p>Our trio boarded the <em>Futai</em>, to be greeted by the body of a human, shot through in the torso. We proceeded down one of the coridors, toward the source of the interference. In one of the rooms on the outer ring, we found a room with three locked, silver-colored boxes. Jax opened one to reveal a pistol. Tariq opened another, at which point a small, dark "xenomorph" darted out, attempting to attack Tariq. We quickly dispatched the small critter, splattering its remains all over the room with a heavy pistol round (it turned out the xenomorph had a soft body). At this point, we looked out the airlock, to observe large clawmarks on the outside of the station, leading in the general direction of the <em>Freeman</em>.</p>
	<p>We proceeded into the next room, the security office, where we observed that only a few cameras on the station were working. Jax opened a cabinet to reveal an antique, bolt-action rifle. Meanwhile, our AGI hacker plugged himself into the station's systems, creating an isolated fork of himself running in parallel. He was able to observe a few videos, one of some larger xenomorphs eating humans, one of a nest of xenomorphs, and some information on "Roma", the station's AI, who had been "cornered" to just a portion of the station's mesh. At the end of this, the AGI's fork was attacked by a basilisk hack, so the fork was promptly deleted.</p> 
	<p>We continued to search for the source of the interference, but chose a different route (in case our hacking had alerted any hostiles). In a room, we were attacked by two of the large xenomorphs, but again we were able to quickly dispatch them. It turned out, however, their insides were acidic: after we splattered the xenomorphs, there was still the danger of the blobs of acid floating around the room.</p>
	<p>The next room, a machine shop, revealed the source of the interference: a bot, which was continuously banging itself against a wall. The AGI simply shot the bot, destroying it, and opening up the wireless channels. At this point, the <em>Freeman</em> disconencted from the <em>Futai</em>, and we got a brief message from Krone that we were on our own. Jax, who viewed Krone as almost a sort of father figure, seemed to take this abandonment stoically, not being that incredibly saddened by it. So, abandoned by our "owner", we wondered how to proceed. The AGI wanted to find Roma, while Tariq just wanted to get to the shuttle so we could get the hell off this station.</p>
	<p>So, heading toward the shuttle, we entered the ops room. There, we found Roma's server, and the AGI was able to plug Tariq's ecto into the computer, so we could chat with Roma. Roma demanded we rescue the lone survivor, whom she had grown attached to. We considered totally disregarding her request, but decided that was dangerous (since she might become angry, and attempt to take over the shuttle we were planning to Shanghai). So, we had Jax grab a plasma cutter, jump onto the surface of the station (using magnetized boots), and cut a hole into a location that we had Roma instruct the survivor to run to.</p>
	<p>The survivor attempted to climb through the breach, but was yanked down by a xenomorph. Jax heroically jumped through the breach to recover the suvivor, while Tariq and the AGI stayed aboard the shuttle (and gunned down a xenomorph they noticed climbing along the exterior of the station). Jax was able to kill the xenomorph that was attacking the survivor. Then, Jax grabbed the suvivor, tossed him through the breach, causing him to deflect off the shuttle, and spin into open space.</p>
	<p>Jax got back on the shuttle, and we manuevered after the survivor. On our trajectory, we began to approach the <em>Freeman</em>. Krone asked what had happened to us. When Tariq revealed that there were some sort of alien/TITAN nastiness aboard the station, Krone again basically told us we were on our own, and fired up the <em>Freeman</em>'s engines to get the hell out of there.</p>
	<p>We were able to grab the survivor, who was sleeved into a cheap case morph. However, the AGI was worried the survivor was TITAN-infected, so Jax decapitated the case, shutting it down, before pulling out its stack. At this point, we realized the shuttle's automatic nav system, programmed before the Fall, didn't have any location closer than Mars programmed into it. Mars would take several months to reach. The bad thing about this is that Jax, sleeved as a biomorph, would not be able to suvive without supplies like food. We realized at this point, however, the station had a functional egocaster. So we turned around, and began to head back to the station, our intention being that we would egocast ourselves to Extropia.</p>
