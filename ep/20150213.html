    <h2>game summary for 2015, February 13</h2>

	<p>We began in the office building that was being attacked by a tactical team. An unconscious Danny Jim, along with an immobilized, badly-damaged Kimiko, laid on the ground in front of the tactical team. Huey Lewis, having been shot up bad by the tactical team, began to flee down the hallway. The squad began to pursue Huey, but Derpina was able to divert all but one of them off by using deception over compromised communication channels. The single squad member (their leader) continued to chase Huey, as Huey went up a stair well. Herpert, Derpina, and Skripatch emerged from the basement, and went after Huey to try to assist him. They were able to reach Huey and the pursuing tactical sergeant before Huey got to the rooftop. Herpert (IIRC) was able to disarm the sergeant by heating up his weapon with a microwave agonizer. We took some more shots at the disarmed tactical leader, before he then decided to tackle Herpert, causing both of them to start tumbling down the stairs. The tactical leader ended up unconscious and badly hurt, while Herpert remained mostly unscathed. Huey pocketed his pistol, and grabbed the rail assault rifle the tactical leader had dropped.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile on the ground floor, Doc was able to reach Danny Jim and Kimiko. A second wave of patrol officers was about to attack the building, so, working quickly, <strong>Doc was able to pop Danny Jim's stack</strong> using a utilitool. Then, using some repair spray, he was able to do some very quick, field-expedient repairs on Kimiko. The two ducked into a janitor's closet as the second wave of cops entered. Doc was able to scrounge up a janitor's uniform (belonging to one "Quinn"), while Kimiko transformed into an industrial vacuum.</p>

	<p>Huey, meanwhile, was contacted by his associate, Mr. Morgan. It turned out Morgan had access to a modicum of intelligence about what was happening in Nova Timbuk, and could infer that Huey was not in great shape. So, <strong>Morgan offered a way out: Huey (and his comrades) could meet a person working in the trash disposal area. Said person had access to the mass driver, which could then launch the team away from the hab</strong>. Huey quickly relayed the info to the rest of the party.</p>
	
	<p>Doc and Kimiko were able to make their way out of the building, but were stopped at the cordon. Doc, unforunately, was not good at lying, so the cops, slightly sucpicious, began to question him. Over the mesh, Doc asked Huey to fire off some rounds to distract them--Huey obliged, letting loose a burst from the rifle. The cops, worried and distracted, just ordererd Doc to leave with his "vacuum" at this point. Herpert, Derpina, Skripatch, and Huey then began to make their own way out of the building, but encountred some more cops. Forunately, Derpina was able to talk their way out of the cordon.</p>

	<p>Past the cordon, we all got together and hailed a taxi to bring us to the mass driver. The driver was suspcious and/or worried because Huey was so injured, but Neural Ninja wired him 1000 cryptocreds in an attempt to buy his silence. At this point, <strong>Neural Nnja also activated a script that involved a wireless link on the outside of the hab (I did not catch whether this involved sending an order to build one, or activating one that had already been built, to beam a transmission off the hab).</strong></p>

	<p>We got dropped off at the dump, and began to make out way down to the sublevel. In the distance, we could hear sirens approaching. In the coridor outside the mass driver, we met Morgan's contact, "Mac". Mac was very spooked at this point by the police response, so he demanded we kill him to provide him an alibi. Huey intially tried to shoot him, but was so unsteady from his injuries, he missed. Another party memeber successfully shot Mac, who then took a few seconds to expire, spending his last few moments of pre-resleeving consciousness complaining that it hurt more than he anticipated.</p>

<p>We got into acceleration suits as the police began to blow down the doors we had locked behind us: this would be a bit tense, since we could only launch one person at a time, and the driver took a bit of time to recharge between launches. A very injured Huey stepped into the driver first, handed off the assault rifle, and got shot out. Followed were Doc, Kimiko, and Herpert. Finally, the cops broke down the last door while Derpina was getting in. They took some shots at here, but the launch capsule was able to safely shield her.</p>

	<p>With all of us safely launched, we followed a ballistic trajectory (plotted by Mac) that sling-shotted us around Mars.</p>

	<p>Two days later (the capsules had a modicum of air and supplies), we were retrieved by scum swarm.</p>

	<p>
		state of things at this point:
		<ul>
			<li>we all have the important data in our mesh inserts (and Neural Ninja may have also beamed it off the hab)</li>
			<li>Huey Lewis is in a medichine-induced stasis, and will need to be put into a healing vat</li>
			<li>Doc has Danny Jim's stack in his pocket</li>
			<li>Kimiko's synth body is pretty damaged, and will need repairs</li>
			<li>Neural Ninja and/or Doc were analyzing the data we retrieved during their two days in-transit</li>
			<li>mission seems to actually have been fairly successful!</li>
		</ul>
