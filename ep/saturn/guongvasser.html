			 <strong>Anarchist poet and journalist</strong>, a pioneer of some of the x-casting journalism, the Vasser-Thompson Award is still given out in the Inner System to commemorate the presumed loss of this figure. During the chaos of the Fall, his updates about getting off-earth and heading to the Outer System were lost. They were lost because he actually delivered a scathing editorial about some of the backstabbing that the hypercorps were engaged in as the Quarantine went down, ending with a denunciation of the people who would become the Planetary Consortium elite. Thus they squashed his final broadcast and helped lose it.
