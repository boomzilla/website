		<img src="oh_med_key.jpg" align="left"> The party (consisting of <strong>Doc</strong>, <strong>Novak</strong>, <strong>Molly</strong>, and <strong>Arkos's two drones</strong>--<strong>Feron and Martin</strong> lagged behind, while <strong>Tai</strong> took off once we got inside) entered the "Objective: Helsinki" and took up position on the interior side of the airlock (area represented by blue dot, ). In the cargo bay, we spotted what seemed to be two forks of <major_npc>Timothy Hatun</major_npc> (sleeved into a slitheroid, wielding an SMG; and sleeved into a synth, wielding a heavy rail pistol), and also <major_npc>Hashtag Bakur</major_npc> (sleeved into a menton, and wielding a shredder). They were all standing around the middle of the cargo bay's "floor", around a couch and some crates (area represented by red dot, ). Finally, at the other end of the cargo bay stood a container labeled as a nanotech hazard, along with another fork of Timothy Hatun (sleeved into a sylph) (area encircled in yellow).
	</p>		
	<p>
		The sylph fork of Timothy spoke up, demanding to know why the deal with us (he was presuming we were Night Cartel thugs) had changed. We ignored him, and began to take tactical positions around the entryway. Molly, who was drugged up on all sorts of substances, simply began floating towared them, laughing morbidly, and wielding an axe threateningly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Molly's garish display freaked them out enough that <strong>they began to open fire on us, so we returned fire</strong>. The three Timothies put a lot of fire in the direction of Molly, but her body armor and shield allowed her to shrug it off. Hashtag, meanwhile, wasn't as bold, and ran to take cover behind some crates. Molly, with her axe, and Arkos, with his drones, quickly disabled the two Timothies in synths. The third Timothy, in the sylph, tossed a grenade at us, but Molly intercepted it, and absorbed the blast (again, her body armor was so sturdy, she was only slightly wounded).
	</p>
	<p>At this point, we noted the slyph seeming to interface with the door to the interior, but we were able to knock him unconscious just as he opened the door. However, we also noticed <strong>the nanocontainer had opened</strong>, and there was a distinct shimmering beginning to form in that direction. Arkos, also doing some infosec stuff, had noted that the nanocontainer, 1: had, indeed, been opened, and, 2: was rigged with various sorts of explosives.
	</p>
	<p>
		Arkos and Doc quickly alerted everyone in the room (including Hashtag) that the nano swarm was out. Hashtag yelled at us to "use the failsafe", and we all began to run out of the room--Feron and Martin were about to enter the cargo hold, also, but, due to the active nanoswarm, they, too, began to run away.
	</p>
	<p>
		Molly grabbed the two disabled synths of Timothy and tossed them toward our entrance--Arkos's drones then grabbed them, and began to carry them out. Doc tossed a nanodetector in the direction of the swarm (but missed, and didn't really get a good reading), and then followed everyone else out. As we were fleeing, we noticed the swarm doing surreal things to the environment: it was warping the platform into tiny "hairs", making it look like the floor had goosebumps. It was also emitting a strange sound, like a beeping or static sound.
	</p>
	<p>
		Arkos had began to flood the cargo hold with oxygen, but waited a few seconds for everyone to get out before setting off the explosives. He began to get interference: it seemed possibly the nanoswarm was attempting to thwart its own destruction, even disabling one of the charges. Finally, Doc, the last guy, got out, and Arkos triggered the charges. 
	</p>
	<p>
		An end of the "Objective: Helsinki" was basically obliterated, throwing the front parts of the ship forward, and impacting further space craft in the Kronos docks. The Ultimate enforcers, the true power on Kronos, began to deploy cordones to control the chaos, and figure out why the ship had exploded, and presumably who was reponsible.
	</p>
	<p>
		Except for Martin and Arkos's actual morph, we were all able to exfiltrate back to the "Burning Itch", along with the two remains of Timothy, and also Hashtag Bakur (who had attmped to flee, but was quickly grabbed and cowed into submission). Martin was grabbed by some octopus prostitutes on the "Taco Kamasutra", while Arkos was told to hold position outside amidst the ships (besides throwing up cordones within the Cluster, the KPA also ordered all ships to be held). Martin was able to flee the grasp of the octopuses, hid in an out-of-the-way area, before he finally decided to evacuate his cyberbrain, and return to the "Burning Itch" as an infomorph. Arkos, meanwhile, asked a nearby anarchist ship to let him hide in their ship.
