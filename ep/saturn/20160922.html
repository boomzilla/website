		Tom&#225;&scaron; came to from an extended deepweed trip, and began to go through his enqueued messages, discovering what the party had been up to during his down time. Among the most significant events, their old patron, <major_npc>Mr. Fritza</major_npc> had contacted them with an assignment: in exchange for a sizable (HOW MUCH?) amount of credits, we were to (through various means of our choice) <strong>keep a sample of xenofungus (obtained from a black-listed gate address) out of the hands of a band of Ultimates</strong>. 
	</p>
	<p>
		It turned out that, soon, Feron was to mediate a deal involving that very sample of xenofungus. So, with Feron in the meeting room (along with Garb, who was playing the part of Feron's bodyguard) aboard the <em>Bard's Grave</em>, Arkos deployed some of his drones in the area, Asuramon concealed himself in an adjacent room (using his augmented vision to see through the walls), while Tom&#225;&scaron; (armed and armored up) hung out in the common area, along with Ken Sama (who began to do "street" performances). Within the meeting room proper, there was <minor_npc>Dr. Henry Vulcan</minor_npc>, an expert whom Feron had hired to assess the merchandise. The sellers were a gatecrasher band called the Yellow Jade Krewe, consisting of <minor_npc>Jules Iridian</minor_npc> (sleeved into a crasher) and <minor_npc>Carl Bombay</minor_npc> (sleeved into a steel morph). 
	</p>
	<p>
		The buyers showed up: three people sleeved into bouncers, IDing as "<major_npc>Mr. Lime</major_npc>", "<major_npc>Ms. Lemon</major_npc>", and "<major_npc>Mr. Salt</major_npc>"; along with another person in an inncouous morph (splicer?), IDing as "<major_npc>Tequila</major_npc>". Dr. Vulcan examined the merchandise: besides the <strong>xenofungus</strong> there was also <strong>an artifact: an alien computer part</strong>. Dr. Vulcan messaged Feron with his assay/appraisal: while <strong>the xenofungus was authentic</strong> (or so great a forgery to fool even him), <strong>the computer parts were fake</strong>. Feron informed all parties, out-loud, of the fake. So, the drink-themed trio of buyers (who seemed bored by the whole thing) simply bought the fungus, but ignored the now-worthless computer parts. 
	</p>
	<p>
		With the transaction complete, Feron got a bump (of X-Rep) for mediating the whole deal, and all parties went their separate ways. It was a perfectly smooth buy, with no evidence of Ultimates. As the meeting was wrapping up, Garb noticed something: a small data chip had been planted on his vac suit. He read the data: it turned out to be a brief message from Mr. Fritz. He wished for us (were we not to destroy the xenofungus, but rather capture it) to dead-drop the sample in the airlock of a shuttle, the "Nocturnal Opera" (docked to the side of "Get Fit").
	</p>
	<p>
		As the trio of buyers (along with Teuqila) took off, we realized that, if the Ultimate gang were not to attack now, they would still likely attack the buyers (and nab the fungus), perhaps during the Twinkie Cock Blackout.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We did some social networking to obtain information on both the squad of Ultimates, and the buyers of the fungus.
	</p>
	<p>  
	  The Ultimates turned out to be six in number, and calling themselves, "<strong>Ferris Singh and Company</strong>". They were all likely sleeved into Remades, have been known to use drones before, and were skilled in small squad tactics. Researching further, it seemed likely that all six of the Ultimates were on the "Bard's Grave" when the xenofungus transaction had gone down: in fact, one was likely in the next room over. They had arrived about seven or eight days ago (before the trio of buyers had come in from the Inner System) on an Ultimate fast freighter.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <strong>trio of buyers</strong>, by contrast, had seemed (from reading their body lanugage, and other clues) to be thrill-seeking hypercorp brats who liked to "be edgy" and "play spy". Confirming our suspcions, the trio's true IDs turned out to be:
		<ul>
			<li>Lime: Daniel Corazon, son of corp scientist</li>
			<li>Lemon: Jae-Li Fushimoto, father is a major stockholder in PC</li>
			<li>Salt: Ken Won, mother is an Oversight auditor</li>
	  	</ul>
	  The trio was being protected by "Tequila" (do we know Tequila's true ID?), a local extropian microcorp, who acted as a guide to the automonists for people like this trio.
