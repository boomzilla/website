	<p>After recovering the egos of the <major_npc>Timothy Hatun</major_npc> forks, Doc (with the help of <major_npc>Hashtag Bakur</major_npc>'s previous psychosurgical notes) was able to <a href="https://wirelesshowl.wordpress.com/2016/03/29/eps-wntrgrn-hzrd-handout/">extract information from them via psychosurgery</a>. Several important pieces of information were discovered. <strong>The base of the Grey Wolves, aka the "Wolves' Den", was located on the small moon of "Skoll"</strong> in the Norse group of Saturnine moonlets. Skoll is a small, 6km-long, moon, about a 3-day trip (at present location) away from Kronos Cluster in the "Burning Itch". Skoll was claimed by two pre-Fall megacorps (one from Canada, one from Jordan), which had placed defensive satellites in orbit around the moon. Information provided by the psychosurgican interrogation, however, gave us IFF bypass codes for the competing satellites, as well as locations of the base's two airlocks.</p>
	<p>The forks further revealed that the Wolves were last known to be on Iapetus (a Saturnine moon that had been quarantined due to TITAN activity), but the forks were not sure how the Iapetus quarantine was being bypassed. The forks <em>did</em> reveal that information about the Wolves' infiltration methods would be held on the Skoll base. The forks also revealed that they, along with the rest of the group, had developed strange psychological and ideological patterns. They thought the ghosts of the TITAN victims haunted the tunnels of the Iapetus matrioshka brain ("matrioshka brain" in this case refers to a moon-sized computer: shortly after The Fall, the TITANs had attempted to convert the entire moon into a giant computer). The Grey Wolves had made four previous jaunts to Iaepetus, in a belief that they could recover lost family and countryfellows, before recruiting Hashtag Bakur as a psychosurgeon.</p>
	<p>
		Finally, the two egoes offered a list of the present Wolves:
		<ul>
			<li>Timothy Hatun – sales, technical</li>
			<li><major_npc>Fernando Alp</major_npc> – demolition, security</li>
			<li><major_npc>Sarah Nadir</major_npc> – technical</li>
			<li><major_npc>Johan Nadir</major_npc> – pilot</li>
			<li><major_npc>Cai-Yang Kubat</major_npc> – infosec, cryptography</li>
			<li><major_npc>Zelda Oren</major_npc> – iceteroid mining, technical</li>
			<li><major_npc>Alan Zorlu</major_npc> – leader, social psychology</li>
			<li><major_npc>Juan Akurgal</major_npc> – infiltration, stealth</li>
			<li><major_npc>Ahmet Kahraman</major_npc> – pilot, networker</li>
			<li><major_npc>Paul Sawari</major_npc> – medical, bot repair</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>All aboard the "Burning Itch", we departed Kronos Cluster for Skoll. Before we arrived at Skoll, we were intercepted by <major_npc>Capt. Chadwick</major_npc> aboard the "Silver Corgi". Chadwick reiterated that he wanted us to not only track down the location of the Wolves' Den, but also to put a stop to the Wolves' smuggling activies of IQZ artifacts.</p>
	<p><strong>Chadwick also revealed to Tom&#225;&scaron;, Feron, and Molly that there was more going on with this mission than the surface issue of the Wolves: specifically, he, along with Martin, Arkos, and Tai, were all part of Firewall, and were evaluating the trio of Burning Itch, LLC for Firewall recruitment</strong>.</p>
	<p>Feron asked why they needed new agents. Chadwick (aka "Proxy Snow") admitted "Saturn has a dearth of Firewall agents" due to activities from rivalrous conpiracy/intelligence organizations.</p>
	<p>For various reasons, Tom, Feron, and Molly all agreed to join the conspiracy. <strong>The trio recieved +2 i-rep, along with access to The Eye, Firewall's secret mesh network</strong>.</p>
	<p><img src="../remade_small.png" title="Asuramon" align="left"> Capt Chadwick/Proxy Snow left a beta fork of himself in the "Burning Itch's" server, and also brought along another team member, <strong>Asuramon</strong>, an Ultimate-affiliated Argonaut Medean, sleeved into a modded Remade morph. Finally, Proxy Snow provided us with a few items of gear:
		<ul>
			<li>Vac Pod morph</li>
			<li>heavily-modded Dragonfly morph</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		In the three days it took to reach Skoll, the two forks of Tom&#225;&scaron; spent some downtime chatting with their muse(s), trying to de-stress from all the alien new sights they had encountered in the past few days (i.e. they were, mechanically, healing SV from seeing the TITAN nanoswarm); and also reading up on all the new research on TITANs, etc, they now had access to via the Eye. The rest of the party mostly spend time in simulpsace, trying to learn new skills. Martin decided to resleeve into the Dragonfly morph, and <strong>we all backed up</strong> (aware that we would soon be going on a dangerous mission).
	</p>
	<p>
		As we approached Skoll, we were noted by the two security satellites, who each began warning us off, claiming Skoll was the property of their respective, defunct, corps. We signalled them with the bypass codes, and they let us pass. On Skoll itself, Molly detected the two entrances: a large airlock, large enough to accomodate a spacecraft; and a smaller airlock designed for personnel (but still large enough to accomodate even Arkos's large Arachnakoma morph).
	</p>
	<p>
		We debated entrance tactics for a bit, but decided on keeping the "Burning Itch" and "Ingenious Gentleman" orbiting above, while we sent a boarding party to land nearby to the airlocks. <strong>The boarding party consisted of</strong>:
		<ul>
			<li>Doc (fork of Tom&#225;&scaron;), sleeved into a Hyperbright</li>
			<li>Novák (fork of Tom&#225;&scaron;), sleeved into a Neo-Neanderthal</li>
			<li>Feron, sleeved into a shaper</li>
			<li>Molly, sleeved into a modded bouncer</li>
			<li>Martin, sleeved into a modded, "wonky", Dragonfly</li>
			<li>Asuramon, sleeved into a modded Remade</li>
			<li>Arkos, sleeved into a Arachnakoma (a large-sized morph)</li>
			<li>Arkos's two Guardian Angel drones (both being variants that moved with cold gas thrusters (not helicopter blades), and armed)</li>
		</ul>

		<strong>Remaining behind on the "Burning Itch" and "Ingenious Gentleman" were</strong>:
		<ul>
			<li>Tien (fork of Molly), an infomorph running the "Ingenious Gentleman"</li>
			<li>Beta-Fork of Proxy Snow, as an infomorph in the "Burning Itch's" servers</li>
			<li>Huginn and Muninn, sleeved into a Blackbird</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		As we prepared to exit the "Burning Itch", the boarding party was hit with aerosolized doses of juice (a potent antidepressant that helps a user resist mental stress, but also causes them to act innapropriately), courtesy of Molly. Most of us had suited up, except for Novák (who forgot that this was Molly's way of doing things), and Molly (who was the one who set up the system in the first place). Partially juiced-up, we landed near the base's airlocks, and observed mining robots around the surface of the moon. They seemed to be old, pre-Fall mining robots, but we noted they were armed with seeker pods, and Arkos pointed out that the mining bots seemed to be well-maintained.
	</p>
	<p>We ignored the armed mining bots, and proceeded to the smaller airlock. That airlock had both a mesh interface, and also a mechanical override. Arkos began to interface with the base's mesh, and was able to open the airlock. At that point, however, Arkos noticed someone on the base's mesh was trying to brute-force hack his mesh inserts. Arkos attempted to counter-hack, but he noticed he getting attacking by hundreds of users: he inferred that <strong>the Skoll base's mesh had been taken over a virus, and those 100s of "users" were, in fact, forks of the computer virus</strong>. Arkos terminated his connection to the base's mesh, but <strong>his mesh inserts got infected</strong>.</p>
