		<major_npc>Ahmet</major_npc>, who was a spokesperson for the Grey Wolves, continued to message the group, demanding to know what we were up to, but we ignored him for now. At this point, Asuramon noticed something moving in a pile of trash by the observation tower. Observing it with his t-ray emitor, he observed something that looked boney, like "a lot of fingers". Not taking any chances, he opened fire on the trash pile with his plasma gun, which also caused the saucer bot (which had been modded by attaching an explosive to it), to sympathetically detonate. This all caused the trash pile to ignite into a big fire.
	</p>
	<p>
		The party, at this point, recieved mesh messages from <major_npc>Dr. Vinters</major_npc> and <major_npc>Dr. Specs</major_npc> demanding to know what was going on, and why there were fire alarms going off.
	</p>
	<p>
		Asruamon kept an eye on the trash pile, and noticed there still seemed to be something moving in there. He opened fire on it with his SMG, at which point he felt pretty sure the threat, whatever it was, was dropped. Asuramon replied back to the doctors, "I terminated a biological threat".
	</p>
	<p>
		The Wolves continued to message the party, demanding to know who we were, and what was going on. We continued to ignore them, so they dropped off the mesh. The Wolves then began to assemble in the entry hallway. At this point, in the hangar, we heard a noise, like the sound of metal being twister or deformed; however, we saw nothing. The fire continued to rage in the trash pile that had been obliterated; a door between the hangar and the observation tower slammed shut, likely as fire suppression, and thus separating the two parts of our party. Tien and Arkos, in the observation tower, decided to go the long way around to the entryway, and attempt to ambush the Wolve.
	</p>
	<p>
		Meanwhile, Asuramon, Tomas,  and Fernon were left in the hangar to confront whatever it was causing the noise. Asruamon spotted a "sinous tendril" extending from the rover, likely with some sort of active camoflague. The trio in the hangar opened fire apart, scattering it into a bunch of tiny constintuent components: it was likely some sort of swarm design. We ended up detonating a plasmaburst, and EMP, grenades to make sure the swarm was not able to reassemble.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tien and Arkos went around and ambushed the remaining Wolves in the hallway, quickly taking them down. A single member, armed with a freezer, remained standing, but seeing all his compatriots dropped, he surrenderred. The charges we had set also detonated, taking out the tower, and the base's external communication capability.
