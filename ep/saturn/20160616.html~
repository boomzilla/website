		<major_npc>Ahmet</major_npc>, who was a spokesperson for the Grey Wolves, continued to message the group, demanding to know what we were up to, but we ignored him for now. At this point, Asuramon noticed something moving in a pile of trash by the observation tower. Observing it with his t-ray emitor, he observed something that looked boney, like "a lot of fingers". Not taking any chances, he opened fire on the trash pile with his plasma gun, which also caused the saucer bot (which had been modded by attaching an explosive to it), to sympathetically detonate. This all caused the trash pile to ignite into a big fire.

		The party, at this point, recieved mesh messages from <major_npc>Dr. Vinters</major_npc> and <major_npc>Dr. Specs</major_npc> demanding to know what was going on, and why there were fire alarms going off.
	</p>
	<p>
		Asruamon kept an eye on the trash pile, and noticed there still seemed to be something moving in there. He opened fire on it with his SMG, at which point he felt pretty sure the threat, whatever it was, was dropped. Asuramon replied back to the doctors, "I terminated a biological threat".
