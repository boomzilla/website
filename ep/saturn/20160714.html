	<p>
		We had secured most of the surface element of Snowfall Base, save for the lab with the two scientists. Another Firewall sentinel, <strong>Dr. Tim "Frosty" Frost</strong>, had arrived via a single-person shuttle pod to further assist the rest of the party. Meanwhile, Feron and Arkos decided to rocket off of Iapetus, and return to the "Burning Itch".
	</p>
	<p>
		The remaining party discussed plans, and considered exploring deeper into the moon. To this end, Tien and Frosty decided to confine the scientists within their lab by planting a bomb on the door, then threatening the scientists with it, were they to stray from the lab. Asuramon, meanwhile, searched the hangar to make sure the swarm was truely destroyed, while Tomas guarded the sole survivor of the Wolves we had attacked. At about the same time, Asuramon and Tomas spotted two things: Asuramon spotted some "glittering" in the corner of the hangar, likely indiciative of laser comms between elements of a swarm; and Tomas spotted definite movement in the hallway beyond the science lab.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the confused response, Tien saw nothing down the hallway. Tomas indicated they might be using active camo, so Tien fired a burst of SMG fire down the hall. A few moments later, we all experienced strange... intrusions in our minds. Asuramon was convinced that the two scientists needed to be let free, and began to make his way to the lab door. Tomas, however, successfully identified the odd thoughts he was thinking as coming from *outside* his own mind.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tomas, who had studied cognitive science extensively, had recently read up, on the Eye, about asyncs: he realized <strong>our minds were being compromised by psychic attacks</strong>. Tomas shouted to the group, "Do you know what an async is?! I think it's an async!" No one else seemed to be familiar with the term, but, not taking any chances, Tien gunned down the remain Grey Wolf, in case he was the threat Tomas had indicated.
	</p>
	<p>
		Asuramon continued to charge toward the lab door, the lab door which had an explosive primed. Tien attempted to tackle him, but Asuramon dodged the grappling attempt. Then, Tomas shot Asuramon with a freezer, successfully encasing and contraining him with the fast-hardening foam.
	</p>
	<p>
		The party debated some more over what course of action to take (including Asuramon, who continued to plea for us to open the lab door), but finally we just stacked the last Grey Wolf. We were about to head out of the base, and back to the "Burning Itch", convinced at this point we should just call in the Titanian authorities.
	</p>
	<p>
		At this point, <strong>the charges on the lab door were triggered (not by anyone in the party), damaging the structure of the base even further</strong>. We could have still continued back to the Itch, but curiosity got the better of Tien and Tomas: Tiem, Tomas, and Frosty started to clear a path to the lab door (through the debris that had been generated by the explosion). Finally, <strong>Tien and Tomas peered into the lab and saw something utterly horrible</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="flesh_party.png"><img src="flesh_party_small.png" title="flesh party" align="left"></a>
		Within the lab, no transhumans were visible. Instead, <strong>the surfaces of the lab were coated with meat: living flesh, like a sinewy kudzu</strong>. A nodule extended itself from the meat tangle, and attempted to hit Tien and Tomas with a spray of some sort of foul, bilious-yellow liquid--probably some sort of powerful acid. Foruntely, the spray missed. Tomas and Tien quickly gunned down the monstrosity; Tomas ripping it up with his shredder, and Tien frying it with his flame thrower.
	</p>
	<p>
		Within the tangle of the meat mat (we were later informed it wad called a "<strong>flesh party</strong>"), we saw the remains of some clothing, and some a pair of transhuman-ish bits, which were splayed open (and now popping like hot dogs from the heat). The flesh party stopped writhing after some solid hits with the flame thrower and shredder, but we decided to continue to hose it down a bit longer.
	</p>
	<p>
		At this point, we all decided it was best to just bugger off of Iapetus: Asuramon was now under control of his own faculties (the flesh party had, indeed, been psychically influencing gim), Tien was satisfied there were no other survivors, and Tomas didn't feel so cruious after meething this creature.
	</p>
	<p>
		Everyone now aboard the "Burning Itch", <major_npc>Capt. Chadwick</major_npc> debried us:
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Feron had called in the Titanian Science Police to take over cleanup of Snowfall Base</li>
			<li>the egos we recovered of the "Wolves" would be sent to specialists</li>
			<li><strong>our Firewall cell was now codenamed "Seven Years"</strong></li>
		</ul>
	<p>
		Now with access to The Eye, some discussions (by other agents) could be read, re: flesh parties:
	</p>
	<table border=1><tr><td>
Parallax I remember, during the Fall, carpets of tissue and skeletal growth consuming entire city blocks and habitats. Fields of cilia
waving in the breeze. Eyes peaking out from nooks and crannies. Mouths emitting wailing screams from the walls. Limp fingers, hair,
and genitalia dangling from ceilings that breathed. Nightmarish doesnâ€™t even begin to describe it.
	</td></tr></table>
