		<strong>Feron was beginning to "lose his shit", so Asuramon ferried him back to the "Burning Itch"</strong> with one of Arkos's guardian angels, <strong>leaving just Novak, Arkos, and Molly behind on Skoll</strong>. Molly entered the area with the kitchen, and the gory remains of the maggot-infested corpse, and began to use the improvised flamer the clear out the grossness. She noticed some spart living quarters branching off to the left, before she entered the kitch proper. Right as Molly entered the kitchen, the door slammed behind her, trapping her. She noted in the kitch that the food maker seemed to be busted and inoperable. However, surrounding the food maker, <strong>she noticed an alien... lifeform? of some sort: a sort of spiralling, fractal coral/poylp. Molly felt the strong urge that it was <em>watching</em> her</strong>. She freaked out, and proceeded to torch "every square inch" of the room, finally exhausting the flamer.
	</p>
	<p>
		After the door shut behind Molly, Arkos went up to the door, and simply activated the manual override to re-open it. Molly was fine, physically, but due to the shock of encountering the alien fractal coral thing, she had developed logorhrea. Re-entering the hangar, Arkos began to pry into the slagged remains of the centipede-bot. <strong>Within the synth, he discovered a series of cortical stacks, all daisy-chained together</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Arkos sent a saucer bot down the hallway to the right. The bot sighted what looked like a storage room, and a utility room. Unbeknownst to the party, however, as the saucer got to the end of the hallway, another (infected) drone has ambushed our drone, and compromised it. Arkos recalled his saucer, and, to our suprise, two saucer drones came toward us: our (compromised) drone, plus the drone that had infected it (a weird-looking saucer that had crustacean-like "legs", along with trailing fiber-optic cables).
	</p>
	<p>
		At this point, <strong>Arkos noticed his ego was being hacked</strong>. He realized he had been compromised, but that, <em>maybe</em>, if he were to reboot, the preliminary infection would be flushed from his software stack before it got too far. He announced, "I need to reboot, someone's trying to hack into me", told his guardian angel to protect him, and shut down.
	</p>
	<p>
		The two saucers continued to come toward us: the one with the "crustacean-like" limbs latched onto Molly's helmet, and began to drill in. Molly noticed fractal digits on that saucer. She tried to remove it by swinging her axe at the bot: she damaged it (but not enough to disable it), and thankfully did not hurt her own head. Novak, meanwhile, grabbed the shredder, and fired it one-handed at the saucer that was not yet attached to anything. Despite only having one good arm, he was able to obliterate the one he targeted.
	</p>
	<p>
		Molly's muse ended up becoming compromised by the saucer that was latched onto her head: it sent out a TacNet invite to Novak (who ignored it: he was suspicious of being hacked due to Arkos's warning), and then tried to log onto the Skoll base's network. Molly noticed a bunch of bizarre AR text scrolling along the walls, but, realizing it was some sort of basilisk, closed her eyes, and ignored it. She also shut down her now-compromised muse. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Molly continued to swing at the saucer bot with her axe, and finally, Novak gave the saucer a solid kick, finally disabling it. Unforuntately, Molly's muse seemed to be done-for: it continued to reboot despite her shutting it off, and continued to try to connect to the Skoll base's network. <strong>Molly (forgetting that Novak was a physician) finally decided to physically disable her mesh inserts by jabbing a scalpel into her head.</strong> She was able to disable her muse, but also partially paralyzed herself.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Arkos rebooted, and <em>seemed</em> fine, although he had developed a minor addiction to MRDR. Finally, Asuramon returned from the "Burning Itch" at this point, and surveyed the scene. He noticed Arkos collected fragments of the various infected bots we had killed, and strongly urged him to stop that.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, we went down the right-hand hallway that the saucer had come from. Forunately, it seemed as if the saucers were the only remaining hostiles, as we were not ambushed by anything else. A transparents alumina window looked through to the utility room, which was sealed behind a door, the door being welded shut. On the window was scored the message (in Turkish), "fuck off". Novak looked through the window, and noticed a humanoid synthmorph, plugged into an ecto. On the wall was a tool fabber that had been wrecked.
	</p>
	<p>
		Molly, who seemed pretty shaken up, excused herself, and retreated back to the meeting room prefabricated building in the hangar. The rest of us decided to open up the utility room. Arkos ordered his guardian angel to machine gun open the window. We entered the room, and examined the scene. The ecto the synth was attached to was, in fact, and old-style simulspace server. We surmised the synth was likely housing an ego, so we brough it to the brig.
	</p>
	<p>
		As we entered the hangar, we saw that <strong>Molly had shot herself to death</strong>. However, her morph was still intact enough (thanks to medichines) that she could be revived in a healing vat. (Although she likely is very mentally traumatized).  
	</p>
	<p>
		In the brig, we unplugged the synth from the simulspace server. She "woke up", shouting at us in Turkish and Arabic. (We didn't have access to translation services since we were disconnected from the mesh). Novak asked if she spoke English, but she only spoke a small amount. Arkos, at this point, began to approach the three containers, at the end of the hangar, labelled as "dangerous". Novak as the synth person (who turned out to be <major_npc>Zelda Oren</major_npc>) if they were, indeed, dangerous, and Zelda deperately indicated that, yes, they were. We yelled at Arkos to leave those artifacts along, and he did.
	</p>
	<p>
		We decided to further interrogate Zelda, so we improvised a "black bag" to restrict her wireless signals, and decided to bring her to the "Burning Itch".
	</p>
	<p>
