Several important pieces of information were discovered. <strong>The base of the Grey Wolves, aka the "Wolves' Den", was located on the small moon of "Skoll"</strong> in the Norse group of Saturnine moonlets. Skoll is a small, 6km-long, moon, about a 3-day trip (at present location) away from Kronos Cluster in the "Burning Itch". Skoll was claimed by two pre-Fall megacorps (one from Canada, one from Jordan), which had placed defensive satellites in orbit around the moon. Information provided by the psychosurgican interrogation, however, gave us IFF bypass codes for the competing satellites, as well as locations of the base's two airlocks.</p>
	<p>The forks further revealed that the Wolves were last known to be on Iapetus (a Saturnine moon that had been quarantined due to TITAN activity), but the forks were not sure how the Iapetus quarantine was being bypassed. The forks <em>did</em> reveal that information about the Wolves' infiltration methods would be held on the Skoll base. The forks also revealed that they, along with the rest of the group, had developed strange psychological and ideological patterns. They thought the ghosts of the TITAN victims haunted the tunnels of the Iapetus matrioshka brain ("matrioshka brain" in this case refers to a moon-sized computer: shortly after The Fall, the TITANs had attempted to convert the entire moon into a giant computer). The Grey Wolves had made four previous jaunts to Iaepetus, in a belief that they could recover lost family and countryfellows, before recruiting Hashtag Bakur as a psychosurgeon.</p>
	<p>
		Finally, the two egoes offered a list of the present Wolves:
		<ul>
			<li>Timothy Hatun – sales, technical</li>
			<li><major_npc>Fernando Alp</major_npc> – demolition, security</li>
			<li><major_npc>Sarah Nadir</major_npc> – technical</li>
			<li><major_npc>Johan Nadir</major_npc> – pilot</li>
			<li><major_npc>Cai-Yang Kubat</major_npc> – infosec, cryptography</li>
			<li><major_npc>Zelda Oren</major_npc> – iceteroid mining, technical</li>
			<li><major_npc>Alan Zorlu</major_npc> – leader, social psychology</li>
			<li><major_npc>Juan Akurgal</major_npc> – infiltration, stealth</li>
			<li><major_npc>Ahmet Kahraman</major_npc> – pilot, networker</li>
			<li><major_npc>Paul Sawari</major_npc> – medical, bot repair</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>All aboard the "Burning Itch", we departed Kronos Cluster for Skoll. Before we arrived at Skoll, we were intercepted by <major_npc>Capt. Chadwick</major_npc> aboard the "Silver Corgi". Chadwick reiterated that he wanted us to not only track down the location of the Wolves' Den, but also to put a stop to the Wolves' smuggling activies of IQZ artifacts.</p>
	<p><strong>Chadwick also revealed to Tom&#225;&scaron;, Feron, and Molly that there was more going on with this mission than the surface issue of the Wolves: specifically, he, along with Martin, Arkos, and Tai, were all part of Firewall, and were evaluating the trio of Burning Itch, LLC for Firewall recruitment</strong>.</p>
	<p>Feron asked why they needed new agents. Chadwick (aka "Proxy Snow") admitted "Saturn has a dearth of Firewall agents" due to activities from rivalrous conpiracy/intelligence organizations.</p>
	<p>For various reasons, Tom, Feron, and Molly all agreed to join the conspiracy. <strong>The trio recieved +2 i-rep, along with access to The Eye, Firewall's secret mesh network</strong>.</p>
	<p><img src="../remade_small.png" title="Asuramon" align="left"> Capt Chadwick/Proxy Snow left a beta fork of himself in the "Burning Itch's" server, and also brought along another team member, <strong>Asuramon</strong>, an Ultimate-affiliated Argonaut Medean, sleeved into a modded Remade morph. Finally, Proxy Snow provided us with a few items of gear:
		<ul>
			<li>Vac Pod morph</li>
			<li>heavily-modded Dragonfly morph</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		In the three days it took to reach Skoll, the two forks of Tom&#225;&scaron; spent some downtime chatting with their muse(s), trying to de-stress from all the alien new sights they had encountered in the past few days (i.e. they were, mechanically, healing SV from seeing the TITAN nanoswarm); and also reading up on all the new research on TITANs, etc, they now had access to via the Eye. The rest of the party mostly spend time in simulpsace, trying to learn new skills. Martin decided to resleeve into the Dragonfly morph, and <strong>we all backed up</strong> (aware that we would soon be going on a dangerous mission).
	</p>
	<p>
		As we approached Skoll, we were noted by the two security satellites, who each began warning us off, claiming Skoll was the property of their respective, defunct, corps. We signalled them with the bypass codes, and they let us pass. On Skoll itself, Molly detected the two entrances: a large airlock, large enough to accomodate a spacecraft; and a smaller airlock designed for personnel (but still large enough to accomodate even Arkos's large Arachnakoma morph).
	</p>
	<p>
		We debated entrance tactics for a bit, but decided on keeping the "Burning Itch" and "Ingenious Gentleman" orbiting above, while we sent a boarding party to land nearby to the airlocks. <strong>The boarding party consisted of</strong>:
		<ul>
			<li>Doc (fork of Tom&#225;&scaron;), sleeved into a Hyperbright</li>
			<li>Novák (fork of Tom&#225;&scaron;), sleeved into a Neo-Neanderthal</li>
			<li>Feron, sleeved into a shaper</li>
			<li>Molly, sleeved into a modded bouncer</li>
			<li>Martin, sleeved into a modded, "wonky", Dragonfly</li>
			<li>Asuramon, sleeved into a modded Remade</li>
			<li>Arkos, sleeved into a Arachnakoma (a large-sized morph)</li>
			<li>Arkos's two Guardian Angel drones (both being variants that moved with cold gas thrusters (not helicopter blades), and armed)</li>
		</ul>

		<strong>Remaining behind on the "Burning Itch" and "Ingenious Gentleman" were</strong>:
		<ul>
			<li>Tien (fork of Molly), an infomorph running the "Ingenious Gentleman"</li>
			<li>Beta-Fork of Proxy Snow, as an infomorph in the "Burning Itch's" servers</li>
			<li>Huginn and Muninn, sleeved into a Blackbird</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		As we prepared to exit the "Burning Itch", the boarding party was hit with aerosolized doses of juice (a potent antidepressant that helps a user resist mental stress, but also causes them to act innapropriately), courtesy of Molly. Most of us had suited up, except for Novák (who forgot that this was Molly's way of doing things), and Molly (who was the one who set up the system in the first place). Partially juiced-up, we landed near the base's airlocks, and observed mining robots around the surface of the moon. They seemed to be old, pre-Fall mining robots, but we noted they were armed with seeker pods, and Arkos pointed out that the mining bots seemed to be well-maintained.
	</p>
	<p>We ignored the armed mining bots, and proceeded to the smaller airlock. That airlock had both a mesh interface, and also a mechanical override. Arkos began to interface with the base's mesh, and was able to open the airlock. At that point, however, Arkos noticed someone on the base's mesh was trying to brute-force hack his mesh inserts. Arkos attempted to counter-hack, but he noticed he getting attacking by hundreds of users: he inferred that <strong>the Skoll base's mesh had been taken over a virus, and those 100s of "users" were, in fact, forks of the computer virus</strong>. Arkos terminated his connection to the base's mesh, but <strong>his mesh inserts got infected</strong>.</p>
	<p>We cycled through the personnel airlock, and entered a large drydock/hangar-type area. All over the walls was a weird coppery mesh: perhaps meant to act as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage">Faraday cage</a> to block wireless signals from going into or coming out of the base. Also on the walls was an inscricption in English and Russian:</p>
	<p>
		<em>"Where lies the strangling fruit that came from the hand of the sinner I shall bring forth the seeds of the dead to share with the worms that gather in the darkness and surround the world with the power of their lives while from the dim lit halls of other places forms that never were and never could be writhe for the impatience of the few who never saw what could have been."</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Three storage bins were in the hangar--when we scanned them, they seemed to contained metal scraps, stuff like broken robots and electronics. Also, three pre-fabricated buildings were set up. On one of them, labelled in Turkish and English, was "brig". Molly entered the brig and sighted three morphs: a <minor_npc>synth</minor_npc>; a male <minor_npc>splicer</minor_npc>, possibly unconscious, wearing a vacsuit with scars on his neck where mesh inserts are usually located; and a female bouncer who had commited suicide by headshoting themselves with a pistol. Molly looked to the female bouncer, and noticed a holographic nametag: her name was "<minor_npc>Svetlana Z.</minor_npc>". Some further information scrolled throught Svetlana's nametag: she was an extropian secuirty specialiast, and she had a family. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Molly began to feel mesmerized by the hologram. However, she snapped out of it, and realized she was being attacked by a basilisk. At that point, <strong>Molly and Asuramon both deployed their armor's Faraday shielding</strong>: they were cut off from our TacNet. (Their suits did have external speakers, but <strong>to communicate *to* them, the rest of the party had to resort to shouting</strong>). Also, right after her Faraday armor deployed, Molly tossed a plasma grenade into the brig.
	</p>
	<p>
		Right after the hellball detonated, a few party members heard a noise coming from the brig. Doc idetified it as a person screaming in agony. He reopened the brig, and the synth, now quite active, leapt out at him. He dodged out of the way, and Asruamon and Arkos were quickly able to gun it down. Still alive inside the brig, and screaming in agony, was the splicer. Since Molly indicated that person might be infected, Doc decided it was best to just "put them out of their misery". He drew his shard pistol, and gunned the burned-up person down as he pleaded not to get killed.
	</p>
	<p>
		After Doc killed the splicer, he noticed <strong>a symbol on their body: a sylized DNA double helix that matched the iconography of the biofetish cult, "Ribosome Choir". Moreover, the person Doc had just gunned down matched the ID of a "missing person" ad posted by some evangelists of the Choir on Kronos Cluster</strong>. We extracted his stack, placed it in a specimen container, and continued to look around the hangar.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second prefab building we looked inside contained a series of lockers. In the first locker were five smart vac suits. In the second locker were two plasma guns. In the third locker was a bag full of cortical stacks: five stacks, total. Feron places that bag in another specimen container. In the fourth, final, locker was an older (but not pre-Fall) ecto: it seemed to be a navigation ecto.
	</p>
	<p>
		The third prefab building we checked was mostly empty: it seemed like a meeting room. 
	</p>
	<p>
		With the hangar area now more or less explored, <strong>we turned our attention to two door that lead off. We opened one, to the living quarters. That coridor was full of fog</strong>. Uncertain how to proceed, we also noticed <strong>a sound coming from the second (unopened) door: it seemed to be a rhythmimc clancking noise, like a large centipede would make. Also, the sound of a food maker operating</strong>.
