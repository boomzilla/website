	<p>With two plasma guns recovered, and the ways out of the hangar (deeper into the base) looking dodgy, we took a moment to catch our breath. Asuramon began to check to see that the two plasma guns were functional and not sabotaged (they seemed fine, aside from lacking device AIs). Doc, meanwhile, hitched a ride on one of Arkos's drones back to the "Burning Itch", carrying the six cortical stacks along: his intention was to question the egos in an attempt to find out what was up. </p>
