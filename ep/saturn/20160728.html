	<p><a href="phelans.png"><img src="phelans_small.png" title="Phelans by Anders Sandberg" align="left"></a> After successfully tracking down the "Grey Wolves", we made a burn to join up with the infamous scum swarm, "Phelan's Recourse", to resupply, recouporate, and relax.</p> 
	<p>Within the local area of Phelan's were a variety of ships, including:
		<ul>
			<li>"USS DTF", a ship dedicated to sex</li>
			<li>"The Cage", a ship dedicated to bot fights</li>
			<li>"Dank Skunkwork", a stoner biohacker collective, in a pissing match with some gatecrashing group called the "Triffids"</li>
			<li>"Treehouse", a ship styled as a fantasy Elvish treehouse</li>
			<li>"The Bard's Grave"</li>
			<li>"The Gun Show", a ship dedicated to buffed-out morphs, and also firearms</li>
			<li>"Happy Thoughts", a drug lab and drugs dens</li>
			<li>"Such Sights to Show You"</li>
			<li>"Free Blood" a supply ship</li>
			<li>"Gormond", a ship acting as some sort of restaurant</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>As we entered the swarm, our muses updated us with the latest scum scuttlebutt: there was a hacktivist/mesh trolling group (specific name of this group???) threatening to demonstrate its latest cyberweapon, the "Twinkie Cock Blackout", which, rumor had it, would shut down everyones' comms. A lot of people didn't buy the threat, and instead believed it was just a way for other infosec collectives to play security theater and farm rep by offering "solutions" to this over-hyped rep. The security and militia types in the swarm, meanwhile, threatened to come down hard on anyone who would use scorchers. Meanwhile, this was all reminicist of the recent "Dickbutt Renewal" incident that had happened a few months back.</p>
	<p>Beside the Twinkie Cock Blackout, another interesting thing was the presense of the renegade ex-Jovian Catholic disident leader, <major_npc>Calico Jones</major_npc>, along with her crew of disidents aboard the "Gaze Upon Zeus". Jones and company were headed to Neptune (or the Neptunian Trojans?), but first needed to build up enough rep to acuire reaction mass and other supplies. Although anyone sticking it to the Jovians tends to automatically be popular to the scum (and Jones had done time at the Io prison for her thoughts and acitons), the Catholics were still quite culturally conservative and prudish: the scum were a bit of culture shock.</p>
	<p>Our Firewall cell/ship crew was joined by one "<strong>Ken Sama</strong>", another Firewall sentinel (by night), and a culture-jamming Japan-obsessed journalist (by day).</p>
	<p><strong>Tomas</strong>, who had previously lived on the swarm, was greeted by <major_npc>Finlay</major_npc>, a scum enforcer who was a previous assoicate of Tomas. Finlay mentioned he was up for work, if Tomas needed anything done.</p>
	<p>Tomas went to see some other old friends, but found out a lot of his old collective had since dispersed. While navigating the coridors of the "Happy Thoughts", however, he overheard something suspicious: some Titanian students, visiting the swarm while on break, mentioned taking some sort of substances (petals?) that would "open the third eye chakra". This sounded suspiciously to Tomas like something to do with asyncs, a phenomenon Tomas had recently learned about</p>
	<p><strong>Garb</strong> decided to chill by asking for a Level 5 favor: an orgy aboard the "USS DTF". He invited anyone of us who was interested to join in (it would take at least a day or few to arrange, since such a big favor would invovle, among other things, people resleeving into appropriate morphs). <major_npc>Huginn and Muginn</major_npc> turned out to be interested, and sleeved into a plesure pod to better appreciate the experience.</p>
	<p>While the orgy was being arranged, some gangsters tried to talk Garb into joining them for some sort of heist. Garb ambiguously replied, "we should talk about it".</p>
	<p><strong>Asuramon</strong> and Garb (still waiting while the DTF prepared) decided to check out what was on the menu at the "Gormond". To their complete surprise, the Gormond was a ship devoted to anthrophagy (eating humans). Although they were reassured that the human being served to them was decerebrate (that is, was not even capable of hosting an ego), it was nevertheless quite a shocking dining experience.</p>
	<p>Finally, the "Tryffids", who were rivals to the Dank Skunkworks, hit up Tomas (and another PC?) for favors: they wanted to trash the Skunkworks's labs by exploting the chaos of the impending Twinkie Cock Blackout.</p>
