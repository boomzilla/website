			<a href="aloha_moscow_crop.jpg"><img src="aloha_moscow_crop_small.jpg" title="'Aloha Moscow' map. Click to enlarge" align="left"></a> Aboard the "Burning Itch" were <strong>Feron</strong> (who was relaxing and enjoying some wine) and <strong>Tom&#225;&scaron;</strong> (who was planning to set up a lab in one of the empty cargo containers). They noted that something seemed to be about to go down aboard the "Aloha Moscow", a Polynesian/Soviet-themed party ship. So, they headed over there to join the rest of the party.
		</p>
		<p>
			Part of the 'Aloha Moscow' was spun to produce a small amount of centripetal gravity. Within the spun section, around a bar/dance floor, there were two similar-but-different games going on. <strong>Novo Babylon</strong>, a Arab sci-fi space opera LARP, shared the space with <strong>Dervishes of Agrabah</strong>, a fantasy/medieval MARG of chivalry and 1001 Nights. The two games had enough elements to cause confusion among the players of each, leading to faux pas (e.g. breaking of character). The gamers were angered at each other enough that they seemed about to come to blows.
		</p>
		<p>
			Besides the gamers, the trio of <major_npc>Mr. Lime</major_npc>, <major_npc>Ms. Lemon</major_npc>, and <major_npc>Mr. Salt</major_npc>, along with their tour guide, <major_npc>Tequila</major_npc>, were in the bar. Also, there were a few drones (unsure of affiliation, but possibly ship security?). Finally, three of Ultimates were there: <major_npc>White</major_npc>, <major_npc>Red</major_npc>, and <major_npc>Green</major_npc>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The party members themselves were: Feron and Tom&#225;&scaron;, just arriving and in a hallway adjacent to the bar; <strong>Garb</strong>, on the other end of that hallway; <strong>Arkos</strong>, who was outside the 'Aloha Moscow', but teleoperating some drones within the bar; <strong>Asuramon</strong> who had camoflauged himself in an adjacent room; and <strong>Ken Same</strong>, who was in the bar proper, and being confronted by White.
		</p>
		<p>
			At this point, the Ultimates drew their weapons, and a fast and furious shootout began.
		</p>
		<p>
			White drew a mono sword, along with a seeker pistol. Dual-wielding the weapons, he threatened (but did not attempt to strike) Ken Sama with the sword, while he shot at one of Arkos's drones with his pistol. Red drew a plasma gun, and aimed at one of the unaffiliated drones, while Green readied his railgun sniper rifle and (in the process of looking for a target), noted the location of Asuramon.
