Click to enlarge" align="left"></a> Aboard the "Burning Itch" were Feron (who was relaxing and enjoying some wine) and Tom&#225;&scaron; (who was planning to set up a lab in one of the empty cargo containers). They noted that something seemed to be about to go down aboard the "Aloha Moscow", a Polynesian/Soviet-themed party ship. So, they headed over there to join the rest of the party.
