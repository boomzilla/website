			<a href="aloha_moscow_crop.jpg"><img src="aloha_moscow_crop_small.jpg" title="'Aloha Moscow' map. Click to enlarge" align="left"></a> Aboard the "Burning Itch" were <strong>Feron</strong> (who was relaxing and enjoying some wine) and <strong>Tom&#225;&scaron;</strong> (who was planning to set up a lab in one of the empty cargo containers). They noted that something seemed to be about to go down aboard the "Aloha Moscow", a Polynesian/Soviet-themed party ship. So, they headed over there to join the rest of the party.
		</p>
		<p>
			Part of the 'Aloha Moscow' was spun to produce a small amount of centripetal gravity. Within the spun section, around a bar/dance floor, there were two similar-but-different games going on. <strong>Novo Babylon</strong>, a Arab sci-fi space opera LARP, shared the space with <strong>Dervishes of Agrabah</strong>, a fantasy/medieval MARG of chivalry and 1001 Nights. The two games had enough elements to cause confusion among the players of each, leading to faux pas (e.g. breaking of character). The gamers were angered at each other enough that they seemed about to come to blows.
		</p>
		<p>
			Besides the gamers, the trio of <major_npc>Mr. Lime</major_npc>, <major_npc>Ms. Lemon</major_npc>, and <major_npc>Mr. Salt</major_npc>, along with their tour guide, <major_npc>Tequila</major_npc>, were in the bar. Also, there were a few drones (unsure of affiliation, but possibly ship security?). Finally, three of Ultimates were there: <major_npc>White</major_npc>, <major_npc>Red</major_npc>, and <major_npc>Green</major_npc>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The party members themselves were: Feron and Tom&#225;&scaron;, just arriving and in a hallway adjacent to the bar; <strong>Garb</strong>, on the other end of that hallway; <strong>Arkos</strong>, who was outside the 'Aloha Moscow', but teleoperating some drones within the bar; <strong>Asuramon</strong> who had camoflauged himself in an adjacent room; and <strong>Ken Same</strong>, who was in the bar proper, and being confronted by White.
		</p>
		<p>
			At this point, the Ultimates drew their weapons, and a fast and furious shootout began.
		</p>
		<p>
			White drew a mono sword, along with a seeker pistol. Dual-wielding the weapons, he threatened (but did not attempt to strike) Ken Sama with the sword, while he shot at one of Arkos's drones with his pistol. Red drew a plasma gun, and aimed at one of the unaffiliated drones, while Green readied his railgun sniper rifle and (in the process of looking for a target), noted the location of Asuramon.
		</p>
		<p>
			Arkos opened fire with one of his drones, but missed and shot up the bar instead. At the same time, he began to probe the Ultimates' mesh defences. Asuramon also opened up with a hail of SMG fire, killing Green and wounding Red. Feron and Garb began to call for militia assistance and announce the gunfight on the mesh social networks, while Ken Sama began to live stream the whole thing.
		</p>
		<p>
			At this point, two synthmorphs (in a gargoyle and a normal synth) burst into the room and began to attack the trio of drink-themed hyperelites.
		</p>
		<p>
			White, seeing his comrade just blown away, dove over the bar to get cover while Red opened fire with the plasma gun on Asuramon's position. His shot was true, but Asuramon's morph was tough enough to survive the hit. Feron and Arkos noted, also, that they were being hacked, but were able to thrwart the intrusions (Ken Sama was also being attakced on the mesh, but did not note it). However, Arkos was then able to locate the position on the remaining Ultiamtes, in a nearby room.
		</p>
		<p>
			The two synths quickly dispatched the hyperelites--the Gargoyle then grabbed the briefcase containing the xenofungus, and began to run for the exit behind the bar.
		</p>
		<p>
			Asuramon continued to blast away at the targets. <strong>One of his shots hit a critical spot on Red's plasma gun, causing the plasma gun to explode</strong>. Red was just oblitered (even his stack gone), along with several bystandards. Two of the hyperelites were dropped, although Lemon was still conscious and shouting. Ken Sama also got caught in the explosion, and was damaged enough that he went unconscious. Asuramon, also hurt by the blast, but still standing, continued to blast away, and finally was able to drop the remaining synth, who had been running toward the exit with the xenofungus.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the nearby room, with <major_npc>Blue</major_npc>, <major_npc>Orange</major_npc>(?), and their leader, <major_npc>Maha Raj</major_npc>, the remaining Ultimates noted Arkos's hacking attempts, announced, <strong>"This isn't over"</strong>, and then went offline. Blue opened the door leading toward the bar, and <strong>set off a freezer mine that Garb had tossed their way</strong>, trapping himself.
		</p>
		<p>
			Asuramon gunned down the remaining Ulimate in the bar (White), finally pacifying the scene.
		</p>
		<p>
			Orange took off through some access panels.
		</p>
		<p>
			Maha Raj himself took off through the hallway. Tom&#225;&scaron; and Garb took a few pot shots at him, managed to nick him, but he was easily able to shrug off the wound. He activated some active camoflauge, and took off, escaping the scene.
		</p>
		<p>
			With the violence wrapping up, the state of the party was:
			<ul>
				<li>Tom&#225;&scaron;, unharmed</li>
				<li>Feron, unharmed</li>
				<li>Garb, unharmed</li>
				<li>Arkos, unharmed, but with damaged or destroyed drones</li>
				<li>Asuramon, wounded</li>
				<li>Ken Sama, badbly damaged and unconscious</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The state of the Uliamtes was:
			<ul>
				<li>Maha Raj, minor wound, escaped</li>
				<li>White: dead, but with recoverable ego</li>
				<li>Green: dead, slagged stack</li>
				<li>Red: dead, slagged stack</li>
				<li>Blue: ego erasure</li>
				<li>Orange: ego erasure</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The two synthmorphs both had recoverable stacks, and the Gargoyle's morph was salvagable. The hyperelite Lemon was still conscious and shouting, but her two compatriots were dropped, either unconscious or dead. Their guide, Tequila had hid somewhere during the action. Several bystandards had been hurt, some even dying and losing their stacks in the plasma explosion.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some things to consider:
			<ul>
				<li>many bystandards were hit in the violence: will the swarm blame us?</li>
				<li>will those hyperelite scions (or their powerful parents) make us?</li>
				<li>is the Ultimate gang (Ferris Singh and Company) going to come after us for revenge?</li>
				<li>White is now in our ego prison</li>
				<li>So are the two synths</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Some other remaining things, besides the Ultimates:
			<ul>
				<li>petal asynch cult?</li>
				<li>Octopus gangsters?</li>
				<li>weapons shipment?</li>
				What else?
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			In terms of goods of cred, the party recieved:
			<ul>
				<li>payment for the xenofungus and ego of White</li>
				<li>two unscathed Remades, and a dead (but salvagable) Remade</li>
				<li>salvagable Gargoyle</li>
				<li>ego of White</li>
				<li>ego of the two synths</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Everyone gets 9 Rez.
