	<p>With two plasma guns recovered, and the ways out of the hangar (deeper into the base) looking dodgy, we took a moment to catch our breath. Asuramon began to check to see that the two plasma guns were functional and not sabotaged (they seemed fine, aside from lacking device AIs). Doc, meanwhile, hitched a ride on one of Arkos's drones back to the "Burning Itch", carrying the six cortical stacks along: his intention was to question the egos in an attempt to find out what was up.</p>
	<p>
		The remaining party on Skoll opened one of the doors leading deeper into the base (into the hallway with all the mist), and observed a biomorph floating about 40 meters down the hallway. As we looked at it closer, we observed that the (likely (and hopefully!) dead) biomorph <strong>was covered in small, writhing worm or maggot-type creatures</strong>. This was a pretty gross sight, to the point where Arkos began to feel dizzy, while Feron started to overly fixate on the subject of worms. Almost immediately after we saw the worm body, however, we began to gun it down. The morph burst open, sending chunks of maggot-ridden flesh flying. Thankfully, Molly re-closed the door in time, preventing the debris from entering the hangar where the party was.
	</p>
	<p>
		Asuramon began popping open access panels in the hangar in hopes of isolating the living quarters, but he realized the living quarters were isolated, not just in terms of power and mesh infrastructure, but that there was even a vaccuum gap (a la a coffee thermos) between the living quarters and the hangar. Arkos and Molly began to jury rig a missle by attaching a grenade to a saucer bot (in hopes of remotely taking out the food printer), while Asuramon jury-rigged a flame thrower for Novak to use to incinerate the maggots and flesh chunks. Feron, at the moment pathologically obsessed with worms, began to chat with Novak about the subject. Novak, high on juice, brought up fascinating anecdotes about his time in medical school involving dead morphs and worms.
	</p>
	<p>
		Right as we opened one door to send in our improvised missle, the second door opened, and <strong>out emerged a bizarre synthmorph, long and worm-like, looking like maybe a half-dozen synthmorphs all crammed together, and with a bunch of limbs radiating out along its axis</strong>. At its front was a lamprey-like jaw, full of smaller worm-like constructs. It produced a chittering noise.
	</p>
	<p>
		Immediately, the synth grabbed onto Novak, puncturing his suit, and seriously mangling his left arm. Asuramon, however, quickly began to gun down the synth using one of the recovered plasma guns. He even managed to send a shot down the synth's maw (noticing the sight of "human-like" eyes within the maw). Arkos also began to gun down the synth-worm, and quickly Novak was able to escape, while the synth seized up. 
	</p>
	<p>
		With Novak's suit punctered, a few of the party members began to talk, out-loud, about just killing Novak, since his fork (Doc) was still alive. Novak, of course, took exception to all of this. Instead, however, Molly made mention that we'd use decomtamination procedures upon re-boarding out spacecraft. Molly then applied to repair spray to Novak's suit to re-seal it.
	</p>
	<p>
		We noticed the synth-worm was still twitching spastically. Moreover, a weird sound was eminating from it: Feron realizes the sound was the <strong>sound of multiple synth voice boxes, maybe each belonging to an ego, screaming in agony and insanity</strong>: likely multiple egos, or possible one ego belonging to multiple merges, inhabited the synth-worm. Moreover, we suspected the synth-worm was beginning to repair itself. So, <strong>Asuramon unloaded his plasma gun onto the twitching synth-worm, reducing it to slag</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		We finally sent out saucer bot grenadier down the hallway where the worm-man and food printer were. We closed the door behind it, and heard the loud thud as the explosive went off. However, we still weren't sure whether we totally destroyed the food printer (which we suspected of printing those maggot things), or whether we had merely partially damaged it.

		the party's state at this point:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Novak</strong> has a mangled left arm, and is high on juice and grin</li>
			<li><strong>Doc</strong> is on the "Burning Itch", about the question the egos in the recovered stacks. However, he will return to Skoll if contacted</li>
			<li><strong>Feron</strong> has taken two psych traumas, leading to a pathological fixation on worms, and also he is in a blackout (i.e. he will act normally for the moment, but he is making no long-term memories, and will have no memory of his actions on Skoll)</li>
			<li><strong>Molly</strong> is high on juice</li>
			<li><strong>Tien</strong>, Molly's infomorph fork, is standing by on the "Ingenious Gentleman", making sure the spacecraft stay secure and uninfected.</li> 
			<li><strong>Martin</strong> mostly hung back, and is fine</li>
			<li><strong>Arkos</strong> was shaken up by the worm-man, and is feeling dizzy</li>
			<li><strong>Asuramon</strong> is nervous about synthmorphs coming to harvest his arms.</li>
			<li><major_npc>Huginn and Muginn</major_npc> are hanging out on the "Burning Itch"</li>
			<li><major_npc>Capt. Chadwick</major_npc>'s beta fork is hanging out in the "Burning Itch"'s servers, monitoring the situation</li>
