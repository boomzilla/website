<p>Area descriptions use the side of the ship from which
the solar panel extends as the arbitrary “up” direction.
“Left” and “right” directions are relative to a character
looking into the area from a given entrance.</p>
<p><em>1. Docking Spar</em></p><p>
The spar is an open truss with a standard docking ring
on one end attached to a heavy plastic umbilicus two
meters wide. It’s a cheap solution that hasn’t stood up
well to extended exposure to space. The docking ring
itself is functional, but the umbilicus has been holed
by micro-asteroids in many places along its length and
won’t pressurize. Characters trying to enter this way
will need to stay in their suits. A standard airlock leads
from here to the utility bay (Area 2).</p><p>
Two LLOTVs are docked along the length of the
spar. Both have been recently gutted, with engines and
power supplies hastily (and sloppily) removed.</p>

<p><em>2. Utility Bay</em></p><p>
This section houses a well-equipped but poorly-kept
utility shop. On the “up” wall above, where the
solar panel connects, are banks of power storage
and monitoring gear. A small airlock on this wall
gives easy access to the solar panel spar (Area 5).
Characters with Profession skills relating to space-
ship or station administration or maintenance who
check the power readings realize on an Easy Test
(+10) that the trickle of power from the solar array
is totally insufficient to operate a ship this size this
far out from the sun; therefore, one or more reac-
tors must still be online.</p><p>
Two standard airlocks on opposite sides of the bay
lead to the docking spar (Area 1) and reactor module
(Area 3). Left and right of the docking airlock are ser-
vice airlocks to the greenhouse (Area 6) and machine
shop (Area 8). The wall below has a deeply recessed
service airlock (about 3 meters) that opens to space
and a service crawlway leading to the life support
pods (Area 4).</p><p>
Just inside the bottom service lock are three large
fuel tanks. Fuel lines run from these to attitudinal
thrusters on the outside of the utility bay and Area
4. These are linked to the thrusters in the ops center
(Area 7), but the ops center has its own fuel supply,
as well as the manual controls for all of the station’s
thrusters. The attitudinal thrusters are sufficient for
station keeping and spinning or stopping the torus,
but not to move the ship any significant distance.
(This was originally done with boosters that have long
since been broken down for parts).</p><p>
The drone Sit is often working here.</p>
<p><em>3. Reactor Module</em></p><p>
From outside, the reactor module looks like a wide,
flattened donut with no hole in the middle. For char-
acters who have spent a lot of time on or around
spaceships, it’s easily recognizable. A standard airlock
connects it to the utility bay (Area 2). The door to the
reactor is locked, but can be overcome with any of
the methods described on pp. 291-292, EP, with a -10
difficulty modifier.</p><p>
Inside, the donut contains the toroidal magnetic
containment chamber common to most fusion reac-
tor designs, monitoring equipment, a fuel processor,
and conduits for venting spent fuel and waste heat
into space. The space inside is cramped, with lots
of handholds, and the air is hot. This is one of the
better maintained modules on the Flower, but even
it looks seriously overdue for a visit from mainte-
nance personnel. Two small airlocks on the flat sides
(above and below from the viewpoint of the door
to Area 2) would give access to space but have been
welded shut.</p><p>
Damage to the reactor walls can temporarily dis-
rupt the magnetic containment field, with dangerous
results. If a character discharges any kind of firearm
or seeker in this area and misses their target with
a Severe Failure (MoF 30+), their attack has struck
and possibly damaged the reactor wall (see stats
below). The containment torus is self-healing (p. 292,
EP). If the donut takes enough damage to exceed its
Durability or suffers a wound, a superheated jet of
plasma escapes the magnetic containment and burns
anyone within 10 meters who fails a Fray Test (3d10
+ 12 [28] DV, AP -10, resisted with Energy armor).
The entire module is also flooded with heavy radia-
tion (exact effects to be determined by gamemaster;
see p. 201, EP).</p>

<p><em>4. Life Support Pod</em></p><p>
From outside, the life support pod is a blocky, heavily
shielded box. Some of the planes along its surface are
recessed, while along the top side there is a row of
four outward-curving surfaces that suggest cylindrical
shapes continuing inside the module, possibly storage
tanks of some sort. The part-cylindrical surfaces run
the width of the module and are capped at its edge
by four heavy, circular service hatches. Inside, it’s an
orderly but tightly packed maze of condensers, filtra-
tion equipment, and algal oxygen vats. The lights in
the room are purple UV tubes (to characters who can
only see in the visible spectrum) for the algae.</p>

<p><em>5. Solar Panel</em></p><p>
The Flower’s solar panel is a single array about 80 
  meters long and 7.5 meters wide, projecting from the 
  top of the utility bay (Area 2). Adjacent to it is a small 
  airlock. Though the solar panel provides a nearly neg- 
  ligible amount of power to the station, close examina- 
  tion reveals that it has been put to another purpose. 
  Conductive materials in the panel have been wired to 
  the station’s communication systems, transforming it 
    into a massive antenna array with enough bandwidth 
    for egocasting.</p><p>
    Anyone entering or checking the airlock between 
    the solar panel and the utility bay will find the broken 
    (but not destroyed) remains of Achilles, the custom 
    bot that accompanied Tara Yu. The exsurgents 
    dumped it here for spacing, but never got around to 
    cycling the airlock. Though heavily damaged, the bot 
    may be repaired. It is still carrying the Tortoise AI in 
    a ghostrider module, which is also carrying a copy 
    of the Myrmidon data—and the Glory virus. Careless 
      techs may find themselves exposed to the AOK hack 
      if they fail to take precautions.</p>

<p><em>6. Greenhouse/Recycling</em></p><p>
This is a huge, cylindrical module nearly 100 meters
long and 20 meters in diameter, separated into four
separate areas (see below). Close inspection reveals
that it was once the passenger module on one of the
immense, heavy-lift rockets used for evacuations
during the Fall. Fittings for acceleration couches and
the like are still present, as well as the pre-Fall equiva-
lent of airplane safety equipment. At some point, great
windows were cut into the module walls, transform-
ing it into a greenhouse. Running along the center of
the module from the hatch to the utility bay (Area
2) back to the new engineering section (Area 6d) is
a one-meter diameter utility conduit with recycling,
water, and nutrient feeds. This conduit connects the
recycling vats (Area 6a) to the plant beds (Area 6b)
and meat vats (Area 6c).</p>

<p><em>6a. Recycling Vats</em></p><p>
The first 20 meters of the module are walled off from
the rest and have a foul, septic reek (apply a -10
modifier to all physical and social tests for characters
who spend more than a minute in this room without
breathing equipment). PCs with any ship or habitat
operations-related Knowledge skill immediately real-
ize that the recycling system here, while still functional,
is working below capacity and suffers from a lack of
basic maintenance.</p><p>
The walls here are crammed with a maze of pipes
and conduits connecting recycling equipment (large
vats, catalyzer units, and the like) to the life support
system, utility bay, machine shop, station plumbing,
and the rest of the greenhouse. This system converts
biological waste, condensation, and meat growth
byproducts from a foul slurry into drinkable water,
fertilizer, and trace elements for the fabricators.</p>

<p><em>6b. Plant Beds</em></p><p>
The plant beds occupy the next 50 meters of the
module, moving outward from the hatch to the utility
bay (Area 2). They end in a translucent wall of heavy
plastic, separating them from the carniculture vats
(Area 6c). This wall has two hatches giving access to
the vats on opposite sides of the axial utility conduit.</p><p>
Originally designed for use in stronger sunlight,
the outer walls of this module are mostly window,
though the windows are dingy and in many places
completely dirt-caked, letting in only faint starlight
from outside. Most of the illumination comes from
stacks of hydroponic plant trays radiating out in
three or four tiers from the axial utility conduit. Each
tier of plants has its own lighting, and the vegeta-
tion averages three meters “deep,” moving from the
   windows toward the utility conduit. The plants grow
  in tangles, with only a fleet of five or six small flying
 drones maintaining them. PCs familiar with growing
food on space stations will notice that almost the
entire crop here is high-yield cereal grains and soy,
with virtually no fruits or vegetables. Most of the
crop is being auto-harvested and fed into a processor
connected to the utility conduit. The processor feeds
a thick nutrient line that runs beyond the hatch at
the far end of the plant beds, into the next section
of the module.</p><p>
The tangles of vegetation afford good concealment;
treat targets hiding among them as having moderate
cover (-20). The exsurgents may choose this as an
ambush spot due to the ample cover.</p><p>
Diên, one of the exsurgent drones, is usually here
tending to the plants.</p>

<p><em>6c. Carniculture Vats</em></p><p>
The equipment here is the best maintained that the
PCs have encountered so far. The walls are lined with
massive, green-lit vats designed to grow cultured
meat and extrude it in an edible form. Examining the
contents confirms what the PCs may already have
realized; all of the vats are growing cultured human
flesh—mostly thigh muscle tissue, with a few organ
meats thrown in for variety.</p>

<p><em>6d. Engine Room</em></p><p>
Separated from the vats (Area 6c) by a hastily-con-
structed metal bulkhead with a single large hatch in
it, the engine room occupies the last 10 meters of the
module—what will be the rear of the ship should the
White Khanhs manage to get it under acceleration.
The builders didn’t put much effort into radiation
shielding. Any character sleeved in an unprotected
biomorph who spends more than five minutes in this
room loses 5 SOM and other radiation effects the
gamemaster desires (p. 201, EP) until they receive
medical attention in a healing vat.</p><p>
Unlike the attitudinal drives elsewhere on the ship,
the rockets cannibalized from the other spacecraft and
attached outside here are nuclear, so there are no fuel
tanks. Instead, thrust mass comes from two large water
pipes running from the utility conduit in 6c. Apparently
the designer’s plan was to pull thruster mass directly
from the station’s water supply—a suicidal plan, on the
face of it, as it would exhaust all of the station’s water,
as a Hardware: Aerospace or appropriate Knowledge
skill will discern. The dormant Mother, however, would
survive long enough to be immolated by the sun.
</p>

<p><em>7. Ops Center</em></p><p>
From the outside, ops resembles the bridge module
found on any bulk freighter, implying that it probably
contains sensor systems, emergency thrusters and life
support, and a lot of computing power. The inside,
however, is far different than expected. The walls,
windows, and equipment here are all covered in a 40
centimeter-thick layer of pinkish-gray human flesh—
the transmogrified form of Phuong Lê, the exsurgent
Mother (discovering this fact inflicts mental stress; see
p. 24). The flesh is thicker in some places where Phuong
Lê’s many wombs swell with embryos. Every surface
moves gently to the slow rhythm of respiration and the
flesh occasionally shifts from the pre-natal stirrings of
exsurgent brood. Here and there, manual instrument
banks, designed to operate the station in case the ship’s
mesh fails, protrude from the flesh. The room is lit only
by instrument panels. Lê’s bloated face peers up from a
hump of flesh, surrounded by six spiky maws opening
on what used to be her throat. When not chomping on
raw meat fed to them by Sit, all seven mouths inces-
santly sing a soft lullaby. Drifting slightly above and
behind Lê’s face are her arms, which have metamor-
phosed into a pair of 3 meter-long prehensile tentacles
with stubby grasping digits at their tips.</p><p>
Wei, Dexter Vo’s muse, pays close attention to
surveillance feeds coming from this module, and any
detected intruders will be attacked soon after. Char-
acters exposed to Lê’s body fluids (which could easily
happen in a firefight) have the standard chance of
contracting Glory (p. 19). Lê will initially ignore PCs,
but if they try to damage her, she will lash out with
her tentacles and psi sleights.</p><p>
Lê’s breeder mate, Bian, is usually found here, in-
seminating the Mother. One of the drones, Wu, is typi-
cally here as well, feeding and caring for Phuong Lê.</p>
<p><em>8. Machine Shop/Drone Bay</em></p><p>
The station’s fleet of harvester drones are still opera-
tional, and PCs may occasionally see them entering
or leaving the station alone or in small groups. There
are ten drones in all, and at any time half of them
will be away from the ship harvesting water and other
materials from nearby rocks.</p><p>
The machine shop contains a large-format cornucopia machine, a number of smaller makers, materials
storage, tools, and a pair of repair tender rocket sleds
designed to move heavy equipment out to docked
shuttles. Two flexbots (p. 144, EP) are racked on
one wall; neither is occupied, but they’re in working
condition. There are two large service airlocks, one
of which is occupied by a rocket sled, and a bank of
vacsuits. In the center of the room is the immense joint
around which the station’s crew torus rotates. Two of
the torus’s four spokes contain lift shafts, while the
other two have dimly lit open floatways with ladder
rungs running along their sides.</p><p>
The Myrmidon hardware fragments are here, hap-
hazardly stacked in a series of bins shoved under a
workbench. They are relatively easy to find, as they
look like large chunks of slightly-charred military
satellite. The smallest piece is about 20 centimeters
long, while the largest is over 2 meters. The very size
of them should make PCs nervous, as the amount of
computing power in a 2 meter-long processing block is
almost sufficient to birth a seed AI—like the TITANs.
Such systems are illegal in most places. The pieces are
self-documenting, and connecting a power supply to
them is a simple matter for any character with Hard-
ware skill. If any character powers the fragments up
and examines their documentation, they are subject to
the AOK hack effect of the Glory virus (p. 19).</p><p>
Sitting innocuously on the workbench above the
Myrmidon fragments is the Glory nanobot hive built
by Phuong Lê. From the outside, it doesn’t look like
exsurgent tech; Lê built the alien-looking part inside
of an old perimeter defense drone fuselage. If powered
up, it releases a mist of Glory nanobots that expands
in a sphere at a rate of 1 meter per Action Turn to
a maximum volume of 5 meters across. Characters
standing in the area of effect as the swarm expands
must make a Fray Test to get out of the way. Failure
means the character has the standard chance of con-
tracting Glory from physical exposure (p. 19).</p><p>
Because the machinery in this room provides a lot of
hard cover (-10 to -30 modifiers), this is another likely
location for the exsurgents to set up an ambush.</p>

<p><em>9. Crew Torus</em></p><p>
The rotating crew torus is 250 meters in diameter, with
over 750 meters of floor space. Gravity at floor level
is Mars standard (0.36 g). Large portions of the torus
are unused space, filled with junk or simply empty.
Access is obtained via spokes leading to the machine
shop (Area 8), or by two small airlocks on opposite
ends of the torus.</p>

<p><em>9a. Med Bay/Resleeving Center</em></p><p>
This area includes four healing vats (p. 326, EP), ten
morph storage tanks (half of which are occupied by
morphs transformed into immolator exsurgents), an
ego bridge (p. 328, EP), a fabber (p. 327, EP) for
making and disposing of medical supplies, and a fully
operational examination and surgical setup.</p>

<p><em>9b. Rec Area/Kitchen</em></p><p>
The rec area is a maze of couches and padded chairs,
most of which face a huge holovid screen. Also pres-
ent are the smashed wreckage of a three-dimensional
foosball table, a board game table, a sound-proofed
chamber containing a well-equipped S&M dungeon,
and a racquetball court. The kitchen has two huge
walk-in refrigeration units, food makers, traditional
cooking equipment, and a huge, gleaming meat
grinder designed to combine flesh with a glutinous
rice-derived paste to extrude udon noodles. Almost all
of the food in the refrigeration unit is meat, some of it
recognizably human. In contrast to many of the other
rooms on the station, the kitchen is curiously—almost
clinically—clean and tidy.</p><p>
Four of the breeders—Bui, Quang, Sang, and
Thanh—are usually here, along with Dexter Vo and Ji.</p>
<p><em>9c. Crew Quarters</em></p><p>
The crew quarters contain twenty rooms of various
sizes. The drones share small rooms with a bunk beds,
except for Dexter Vo and Ji, who sleep in a sumptuous
but rather tacky crime lord pimp den with an immense
circular bed, mirrored ceiling, and lots of bad erotic
art. The breeders don’t sleep anymore, but anyone
searching these rooms will find personal effects of
theirs from before their transformations. The remain-
ing rooms are either unoccupied or belong to people
who were long ago eaten. Sammy Li’s personal effects,
including the cufflinks, can be found in a duffel bag in
an otherwise empty room here, just as he described.</p><p>
The remaining 3 drones—Quy, Smith, and Nong—
are here when not attending to various tasks.</p>
