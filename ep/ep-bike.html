		<h2>Bike (Morph-Powered Cycle)</h2>
		<p>A morph-powered cycle, often used by gate crashers on a budget, poor Martian commuters, etc. A variety of form factors are availiable, though many are essentially descendents of pre-Fall mountain bikes. Power is provided by applying a piston action to a set of pedals, then transmitted through a gearing system. Additionally, an auxilary electric motor can provide an output in the range of a typical morph (a few hundred watts or so), allowing either increased performance (when combined with pedaling), or allowing the rider to just rest with the motor does the work. As with most wheeled vehicles in EP, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_brake">regenerative braking</a> is used to recharge the battery. The battery provides a range of about 10,000 kilometers if the bike is powered solely by the auxillary motor, or 15,000 kilometers if augmented by pedaling.</p>
		<p>As with nearly every piece of gear in EP, the bike is typically meshed, with a micro-scale radio connecting to a security spime--to deter theft, the brakes will typically clamp shut when the user is not present. Typical bikes also include a set of lights (on the front and tail end) to increase visibility. A reconfigurable seat allows even non-human morphs (e.g. otcomorphs) to use the bike (although they may find it difficult, if not impossible, to pedal). Smart material tires allow it to pass over difficult terrain such as deep sand. <strong>[Low]</strong></p>
